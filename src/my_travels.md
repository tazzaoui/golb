# Traveling
In the words of Gustave Flaubert:

> *"Travel makes one modest, you see what a tiny place you occupy in the world."*

I do my best to travel whenever I have the chance. Here's a map of the countries I've explored up until this point. I'll do my best to keep this up to date as the adventures continue.
